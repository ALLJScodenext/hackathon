 In the future, we plan to expand by using machine learning to detect weapons in school settings. We will use Media pipe object detection to create this system. We plan to create a data set, which then we will teach it to detect metal. This can decrease school shooting cases in America by a ton, and will give schools time to evacuate the school, and call for help!
